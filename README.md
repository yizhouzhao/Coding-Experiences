1.Quantcast Competition

This file contains the codes for the Quantcast's coding competition last November.The problem is to convert the expressions in an Excel table into the numbers after calculation. 

For example, read in,
--------------------
A3 + A2 | 3 | 0.8
--------------------
B2 / A1 | B3 | 7
--------------------
A3 | A1*A2 | 9
-------------------

Need to get:

--------------------
3.8 | 3 | 0.8
--------------------
1.84 | 7 | 7
--------------------
0.8 | 11.4 | 9
-------------------

2.Dictionary 

This file contains the codes for building a QT application as a dictionary for Middle Egyptian. Like Chinese, Middle Egyptian is a pictograph language which needs me to consider pictures, pronunciation and meanings at the same time.

3.MFA

 Multiple factor analysis (MFA), an extension of PCA or factorial analysis, is a factorial method devoted to the study of tables in which a group of individuals is described by a set of variables structured in groups.

My team members also published the R package for MFA on github, see

I was responsible for the plotting, shiny app and testing parts when building the package.
